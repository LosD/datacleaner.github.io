Today we've released version `5.2.2` of DataCleaner community edition. This release is a rather small one, but was cut due to the blocking nature of one of the handled issues. Here's a summary:

 * Fixed a bug which caused DataCleaner not to be able to start on Linux or Mac environments when launched via the `datacleaner.sh` script.
 * Updated our dependency on the data access library [Apache MetaModel](http://metamodel.apache.org) to their latest version (5.0-RC3) to reap the benefits of several stabilization and bug fixes.

The DataCleaner admins have agreed on [a new process](https://github.com/datacleaner/DataCleaner/blob/master/RELEASE_GUIDE.md) that will enable the community edition of DataCleaner to be released and managed without a dependency on corporate resources for file-hosting and such that have previously been involved in this process.

This puts the community in a position where community members can be granted access to our GitHub repository (for code changes), to uploading Maven artifacts (for releasing) and to this website (for publishing and spreading the word). We believe this set of procedure changes will have a positive impact on the engagement and community building that we wish for DataCleaner community edition to thrive.

The first community edition release with this process is being prepared.
